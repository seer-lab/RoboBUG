<description>Now you can use Code Tracing in the Closer function.
Use what you have learned from the breakpoints to identify the bug.
Use the BUGCATCHER when you have found the bug.</description>
<code>struct target{
    string name[30];
    int x, y;
};

//Robot Targeting Systems Closeness Calculator
//Identifies Closer of two targets based on coordinates
//Uses (X,Y) 2 dimensional coordinates and calculates the difference
//NOTE: Robot is located at (0,0)
//E.g. (50,25) is closer to Robot than (25,75)
target Closer(target t1, target t2){

    <bug size="1" col="20">int xdif = t1.x = t2.x;</bug>
    int ydif = t1.y - t2.y;
    if (xdif + ydif &lt; 0){
        return t1;
    }
    else if (xdif + ydif &gt;= 0){
        return t2;
    }

}
