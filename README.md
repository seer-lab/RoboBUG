RoboBUG
=======

Debugging is a challenging task that can present a great deal of confusion and frustration to novice programmers. In general, Software Engineering and Computer Science education does not sufficiently address the challenges that students face when identifying bugs in their programs. To help students learn effective debugging techniques and to provide students a more enjoyable and motivating experience, we have designed the RoboBUG game. RoboBUG is a serious game that can be customized to with different game levels and programming language examples.
