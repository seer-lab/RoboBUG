RoboBUG
=======

Debugging is a challenging task that can present a great deal of confusion and frustration to novice programmers. In general, Software Engineering and Computer Science education does not sufficiently address the challenges that students face when identifying bugs in their programs. To help students learn effective debugging techniques and to provide students a more enjoyable and motivating experience, we have designed the RoboBUG game. RoboBUG is a serious game that can be customized to with different game levels and programming language examples.

This is the version of the project that was used as a part of our publication:
Miljanovic, Michael A., and Jeremy S. Bradbury. "Robobug: a serious game for learning debugging techniques." Proceedings of the 2017 ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research. ACM, 2017.

A newer version of the game, and its prequel "Robot ON" can be found at https://github.com/sqrlab/RobotON.
